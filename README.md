## Title of the Project
AI-Based Emergency Response Optimization using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting emergency response time and optimizing decision-making during critical incidents using Machine Learning techniques. The system helps identify severity levels, nearest hospitals, and provides intelligent recommendations for faster emergency management.
## About
AI-Based Emergency Response Optimization is a smart web-based system developed using Machine Learning and Flask that predicts emergency response time based on multiple real-world factors such as traffic level, emergency type, geographic location, and time of day.

Traditional emergency management systems often rely on manual estimations and static routing methods. This project enhances response efficiency by integrating a Random Forest regression model that analyzes historical emergency data to predict response time accurately.

Additionally, the system:

Identifies the nearest hospital using the Haversine distance formula.

Classifies emergency severity (Critical, Moderate, Non-Critical).

Provides intelligent recommendations for emergency handling.

Displays feature importance for analytical insights.

This solution contributes to smarter, faster, and data-driven emergency response systems.

## Features
Implements Random Forest Regression for response time prediction.
Calculates real-time nearest hospital distance using Haversine formula.
Automatically classifies Emergency Severity Level.
Generates Decision Support Recommendations.
